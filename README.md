# Test Automation
This project uses JavaScrip + Node.JS to build an API test framework using Supertest, Mocha and Chai as libraries for https://viacep.com.br/ws/91060900/json/

I set up this project mostly just following [Mocha Guide](https://mochajs.org/#installation), [Chai Guide](https://www.chaijs.com/guide/installation/) and [Supertest examples](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest#example).

## Setup

1. Install NodeJS locally.

2. Clone this repository into a local folder.

3. Run `npm install` to install the package dependencies.

4. Run `npm run test`. You should see a browser open and a test case runs.
